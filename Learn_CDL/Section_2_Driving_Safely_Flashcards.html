            { front: "When starting a manual transmission vehicle on a hill, how can you prevent rolling back?", back: "Partly engage the clutch before taking your foot off the brake, or use the parking brake, or apply the trailer brake hand valve on a tractor-trailer." },

            { front: "Why should you avoid backing whenever possible?", back: "Backing is always dangerous because you cannot see everything behind your vehicle." },
            { front: "When backing a vehicle, why is it better to back toward the driver's side?", back: "So you can see better by looking out the side window." },

            { front: "What are 'blind spots' in relation to mirrors?", back: "Areas that your mirrors cannot show you." },
            { front: "What is the main characteristic of curved (convex) mirrors?", back: "Everything appears smaller and farther away than it really is." },
            { front: "What are the three good rules for using turn signals?", back: "Signal early, signal continuously, and cancel your signal." },
            { front: "When should you warn drivers behind you by flashing your brake lights?", back: "When you need to slow down due to a hazard ahead, tight turns, or stopping on the road." },
            { front: "When must you put out emergency warning devices if you stop on a road or shoulder?", back: "Within ten minutes." },
            { front: "Where should you place warning devices on a one-way or divided highway?", back: "10 feet, 100 feet, and 200 feet toward approaching traffic." },

            { front: "How much does stopping distance increase if you double your speed?", back: "The braking distance is 4 times longer, and impact is 4 times greater." },
            { front: "Do empty trucks have better braking than loaded trucks? Why or why not?", back: "No, empty trucks require greater stopping distances because an empty vehicle has less traction." },
            { front: "How should you adjust your speed on a wet road?", back: "Reduce speed by about one-third (e.g., from 55 to about 35 mph)." },
            { front: "What is 'black ice'?", back: "A thin layer of clear ice that makes the road look wet." },
            { front: "What is hydroplaning?", back: "When tires lose contact with the road due to water or slush, losing traction and steering/braking ability." },
            { front: "How should you handle braking in a curve?", back: "Slow to a safe speed before entering the curve; braking in a curve is dangerous." },
            { front: "What is the principal way of controlling your speed on downgrades?", back: "Using the braking effect of the engine." },
            { front: "How much following distance should you maintain at speeds below 40 mph?", back: "At least one second for each 10 feet of vehicle length." },
            { front: "How much additional following distance is needed at speeds over 40 mph?", back: "Add 1 second for safety." },
            { front: "Why is a high center of gravity dangerous?", back: "It makes the vehicle top-heavy and easy to roll over, especially in curves or sudden swerving." }
